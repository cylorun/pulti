# Pulti
A Minecraft Multi-Instance resetting macro in python

# Set-Up
- When you have set up all your instances you can launch the Pulti executable.
- Go to the "Options" tab at the top and change the settings. 
- **NOTE:** The "Instance Format" NEEDS to contain a "*" where the instance number is.
- Open OBS in the OBS menu, go to "Tools" then "Scripts", click the "+" button to add a new script. Locate and select the "pulti_obs.lua" script. It should be in the "assets" folder along with the "pulti" executable.

- Make sure to set up the "Wall scene" and configure the "Instance Format". 

# Features
- Redetect Instances, Redetects the instances, sets their position again and sets titles.
- Close Instances, This will close all instances that were detected by the program.

- Grid-Mode, This will put all your instances in a grid on your desktop, so no obs needed.
